# Flutter Browser App

This is a browser which is designed LIKE the Google Chrome. It has a Developer console, a preview page when long tapping on a link and many more features. Currently, some things are not doable, like only typing google.com, this is a bit tricky due to the webview plugin of Flutter. Leave any Suggestions for new Features as a pull request.
